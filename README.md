# ethnography-of-furry-club-at-usb
This is my ethnogrpahy from a class I took called Cross Cultural Communcations at UC Berkeley under the Sociology deparment. During the class I made a ethnogrpahy on a culutral gorup I am not apart of so I deciced to do my group on the furry club. The furry club is a subculture interested in anthropomorphic animals. Its origins date back to at least the 1980s in science fiction and comic conventions. Due to the diversity within the fandom, as well as fictional portrayals of the fandom based heavily on stereotypes, a certain amount of stigma and controversy is unfortunately associated with the fandom. The Anthropomorphic Animal Appreciation Association hopes to serve and portray the furry population on campus positively, as well as foster community collaboration between furries at Berkeley with other interest-based or academic groups.
